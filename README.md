- Marketing should focus more on younger customers as they represent the key customers. Also, products and marketing which appeal to individuals at high income level should be focused on. More discount should be given to customers who are sensitive to discounts as these people tend to spend more on purchase than others. This should also target individuals with high income as they seem to be very sensitive to discounts compared to those with low income.
